    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hi! I'm <span itemprop="name">Michael Fitzgerald</span>. I'm an undergraduate student of mathematics and computer science at <span itemprop="alumniOf">Lehigh University</span>. Prospectively, I'm an aspiring software developer, though my long-term goals involve contributing to statistical methods used in computing areas like robotics.</p>
    <p>I like to spend my time learning and applying as much as I can. This is reflected in my work ethic: when I'm not studying, I'm working on a project for a research group or for personal sake. Moreover, as a grader and TA, I do more than help others learn â€“ I constantly learn new things from others.</p>
    <p>This personal site is still under development. Feel free to click the links above for more information.</p>

    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <p>Through my coursework and various extracurricular projects, I have developed a strong toolset for software development. In particular, I have experience building efficient software systems with a focus on concurrency and networking. I also have experience in data science using several Python libraries.</p>
